+++INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS+++

- Depending on your operating system, you may need to unblock the files before they can be run.  On Windows 10, right click on the .zip, select 'Properties' and check the box marked 'Unblock'.  You are advised to do this prior to unzipping as otherwise you may need to do it to each file individually!
- Unzip the .zip file to somewhere on your local machine.  Keep all files and subfolders together.

RHINO PLUGIN:
- Open Rhino, drag and drop Salamander.Rhino.rhp into the window to install the Rhino Plugin.

GRASSHOPPER PLUGIN:
- Open Grasshopper, drag and drop Salamander.BasicTools_GH.gha into the window to install the Grasshopper components.  The Grasshopper components rely on the main Rhino plugin so you should install that first.
